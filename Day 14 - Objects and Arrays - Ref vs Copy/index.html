    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 31;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 31,31
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 31

    let name = 'Hector';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Hector Hector
    name = 'Daniel';
    console.log(name, name2); // Daniel Hector

    // Its totally fine to update the original variable since it does not affect the reference to the value

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Hector', 'Rebeca', 'Naty', 'Alessandro', 'Rebequita', 'Samantha'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); // The same

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'El Ians';
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team); // ["Hector", "Rebeca", "Naty", "El Ians", "Rebequita", "Samantha"]
    console.log(players); // ["Hector", "Rebeca", "Naty", "El Ians", "Rebequita", "Samantha"]

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // ðŸ”¥ Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team4[3] = 'Santi';
    console.log('team 5', team5);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const person2 = person;

    // person2.name = 'Hector';
    // console.log(person, person2); // {name: "Hector", age: 80} {name: "Hector", age: 80}

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person2);
    console.clear()
    console.log(person3); //{name: "Hector", age: 80}

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const person4 = {...person};
    console.log(person4);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
